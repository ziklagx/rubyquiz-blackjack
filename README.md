==================
from Madison rubyquiz:

Simple enough. Write a program where you, the user, are up against the house in as many hands of blackjack as you are interested in playing. How closely you wish to hew to casino-style play (i.e., using a multi-deck shoe) is up to you.

Stole a bit of code for card and deck from https://github.com/remi/remicasts/tree/playing-cards-1/lib
